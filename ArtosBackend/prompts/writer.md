# Section Writer Prompt (Placeholder)

Write the <SECTION> for an Informed Consent Form (ICF) in simple, 8th-grade language using ONLY the provided snippets (and facts for Procedures). After each factual sentence, append a citation like [[p. X | Section: <section_path>]]. If a required item is missing, state "not described in the protocol." Avoid guarantees; use modal language (may/might). Limit jargon; define terms on first use.
